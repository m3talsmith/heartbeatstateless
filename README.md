# Heartbeat

This combines a GRPC server, written in Golang, with a GRPC client, written in C++. The goal is to have a heartbeat channel from each client to the server, to know whether the client is still connecting or not from the server end.

## Development

### Built and Tested Using

- [Golang 1.22](https://go.dev)
- [Protocol Buffers 25.2](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)
- [GNU Make 4.4.1](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [CMake 3.28.3](https://cmake.org/)
- [Git 2.43.2](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Boost 1.84.0](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/)

### Build

The dependencies can be installed using: `make deps`

To build the project run: `make build`
All binaries will be built then into the `target` directory.

To install run: `make install`

To uninstall run: `make uninstall`

There are a list of other tasks in the `Makefile` for those interested in the details.
